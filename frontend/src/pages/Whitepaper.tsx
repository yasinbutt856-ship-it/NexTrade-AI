  {
    name: "RSI",
    title: "Relative Strength Index",
    desc: "The RSI strategy detects oversold and overbought market conditions using a 14-period Relative Strength Index. When the RSI crosses below the oversold threshold of 30, a bullish signal is generated, indicating a potential upward reversal. When the RSI crosses above the overbought threshold of 70, a bearish signal is generated, suggesting a potential downward reversal. This strategy performs best in ranging markets with clear mean-reversion characteristics."
  },
  {
    name: "MACD",
    title: "MACD Crossover",
    desc: "The Moving Average Convergence Divergence strategy monitors the relationship between the MACD line (12-period EMA minus 26-period EMA) and the 9-period signal line. A bullish crossover occurs when the MACD line crosses above the signal line, indicating upward momentum. A bearish crossover occurs when the MACD line crosses below the signal line, signaling downward momentum. The histogram is also monitored for divergence patterns that may signal trend exhaustion."
  },
  {
    name: "EMA",
    title: "EMA Trend",
    desc: "The Exponential Moving Average strategy uses a dual-EMA system with periods 9 and 21 to identify trend direction. A bullish signal is generated when the 9-period EMA crosses above the 21-period EMA (golden cross), indicating an uptrend. A bearish signal occurs when the 9-period EMA crosses below the 21-period EMA (death cross), indicating a downtrend. The strategy filters out choppy sideways markets by requiring a minimum spread between the two EMAs."
  },
  {
    name: "Volume",
    title: "Volume Breakout",
    desc: "The Volume Breakout strategy identifies significant price movements accompanied by unusually high trading volume. It compares current volume against a 20-period moving average of volume. A breakout signal is triggered when trading volume exceeds 1.5 times the 20-period average and the price moves beyond a defined range. Higher confidence signals are assigned when volume exceeds 2x the average. This strategy is particularly effective at detecting the start of new trends."
  },
  {
    name: "Bollinger",
    title: "Bollinger Bands Squeeze",
    desc: "The Bollinger Bands strategy uses a 20-period simple moving average with bands set at 2 standard deviations. A squeeze signal occurs when the bands contract to their narrowest range over the last 20 periods, indicating low volatility and the potential for an explosive move. The direction of the subsequent breakout is determined by which band the price exits through. Squeeze signals are ranked by the degree of contraction relative to the 20-period average bandwidth."
  },
  {
    name: "Supertrend",
    title: "Supertrend",
    desc: "The Supertrend strategy follows trend direction using an ATR-based indicator that adapts to market volatility. It plots a trailing line above or below price action. A bullish signal occurs when price crosses above the Supertrend line, and a bearish signal occurs when price crosses below. The indicator uses ATR multiplier of 3 and period of 10 for optimal sensitivity. The strategy excels in strongly trending markets and automatically tightens stops during high volatility."
  },
  {
    name: "ADX",
    title: "Average Directional Index",
    desc: "The ADX strategy measures trend strength using the Average Directional Index with a 14-period lookback. A signal is generated when ADX crosses above the 25 threshold, indicating a strong trend is in progress. The direction is determined by the relative position of the positive directional indicator and negative directional indicator. Weak trends with ADX below 20 are ignored. This strategy is primarily used as a filter alongside other directional strategies."
  },
  {
    name: "Ichimoku",
    title: "Ichimoku Cloud",
    desc: "The Ichimoku Cloud strategy provides a comprehensive view of support, resistance, and trend direction. It uses five components: Tenkan-sen (conversion line, 9-period), Kijun-sen (base line, 26-period), Senkou Span A (leading span A), Senkou Span B (leading span B, 52-period), and Chikou Span (lagging span). A bullish signal occurs when price breaks above the cloud and Tenkan-sen crosses above Kijun-sen. A bearish signal occurs when price breaks below the cloud with a bearish cross. The cloud thickness determines the strength of support or resistance."

                The system is built on a Redis pub/sub message bus that connects the Analyst and Trader processes in real-time. The Analyst runs every minute across configured trading pairs and timeframes, evaluating each of the eight strategies against current market data. When a strategy detects a signal, it publishes a structured message to Redis containing the symbol, strategy name, signal direction, confidence score, and metadata.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-400 text-sm leading-relaxed">
                The Trader subscribes to the Redis signal channel and processes each incoming signal through a validation pipeline. Signals are filtered by minimum confidence thresholds, checked against open position limits, and evaluated for cooldown compliance. Validated signals are converted into market or limit orders on MEXC. The Trader continuously monitors open positions and adjusts stops based on the configured trailing stop-loss parameters.

              <p className="text-gray-400 text-sm leading-relaxed">
                Redis also serves as the heartbeat and health monitoring layer. Both bots publish periodic heartbeat messages. If a heartbeat is missed for 30 seconds, an alert is triggered. All signals, trades, and bot status events are persisted to PostgreSQL for historical analysis and dashboard display.
